# b-fr-core
b-fr-core is a plugin for multiplayer modification for GTA V - FiveM

# Description
It's an early stage of development of b-fr-core (bug-free version as of 9/20/2022). Code is not optimized and pretty as I want it to be.
This version includes obfuscating client-side when building.

## Configuration
Remember to create database named "b-fr-core" or something else, depends what you have in "server/static/config.js".
Configurate "server/static/config.js" at your discretion.
